[Gephi](https://gephi.github.io/): Another data visualization tool, Gephi offers a downloadable application focused on complex graphs of network data.

[D3 (Data-driven Documents)](http://d3js.org/): A powerful JavaScript library that makes it easy to load and visualize data sets within a webpage. It's particularly handy to use to generate graphics from data retrieved through [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface)s, and there's a large community of open source contributors around it making handy variations and templates you can use.

["Raw" Data Visualization Suite](http://raw.densitydesign.org/): This webpage lets you drag or paste in data and quickly play around with several different visualization formats.

[Kimono](https://www.kimonolabs.com/): A user-friendly version of what's typically called a web scraper. This software tool generates an API from a website of your choosing, allowing you to quickly construct data sets from different types of resources.

[Open Data Catalogs](http://dataportals.org/): Data Portals.org hosts a huge collection of (collections of) data, organized by place. This is a great source for municipal data sets: For example, zooming down onto Boston will lead you to the [Metro Boston DataCommon](http://metrobostondatacommon.org/), where you can explore visualizations relating to culture and the arts, among many other categories, and export the raw data from those visualizations or from new ones you create.

[New York Public Library Maps](http://maps.nypl.org/warper/): The New York Public Library has a lot of excellent digitized collections, among them a huge set of maps of New York and other areas. In addition to browsing and search interfaces, they provide an awesome tool called [Map Warper](http://maps.nypl.org/warper/) which lets you overlay historical maps onto a dynamic present-day map. Check out some [Highlights](http://publicdomainreview.org/collections/highlights-from-the-20000-maps-made-freely-available-online-by-new-york-public-library/).
