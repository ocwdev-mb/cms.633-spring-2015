Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Seminars: 1 session / week, 3 hours / session

Prerequisites
-------------

There are no prerequisites for the course. Some programming and design experience is helpful but not required.

Format and Requirements
-----------------------

This class consists of reading discussion, demonstrations of and experimentation with tools and techniques, and hands-on project work. Guest speakers who work in museums, libraries, and humanistic research all discuss their work in relationship to digital technologies. Students are expected to participate in class discussions on readings, group projects and project review sessions. Additionally, students will be asked to annotate readings using the tool [Annotation Studio](http://www.annotationstudio.org).Â Students will work in cross-disciplinary teams on a range of smaller projects throughout the semester and on one larger project in the second half of the term. The final project will be selected before spring break and will have to be completed by the end of the term.

Grades will be based on the following criteria:

Plagiarism
----------

Avoid _plagiarizing_. Plagiarism is the use of another's intellectual work without acknowledgment. Full acknowledgment for all information obtained from sources outside the classroom must be clearly stated in all written work submitted. All ideas, arguments, and direct phrasings taken from someone else's work must be identified and properly footnoted. Use quotation marks to identify all sources of wording that are not yours. Identify sources of ideas with appropriate footnoting.
