[10 Effective Video Examples of Paper Prototyping](http://speckyboy.com/2010/06/24/10-effective-video-examples-of-paper-prototyping/)

[Mockingbird](https://gomockingbird.com/home): A mock-up application

[Trove Australian Archive](http://trove.nla.gov.au/): A crowd-sourced archive primarily built around digitized Australian newspaper sources. Developed and maintained by the [National Library of Australia](http://www.nla.gov.au/), the collection is searchable and continually growing thanks to an active community of contributors.

[Perseus](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/collections): An online library containing a vast trove of texts from the ancient Greco-roman world and beyond. It has evolved into a web-based collection reaching from the classics into many other parts of the humanities, augmented by advanced research tools.

[Old Bailey Online](http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/): A fully searchable edition of the largest body of texts detailing the lives of non-elite people ever published, containing 197, 745 criminal trials held at London's central criminal court.

[The Venice Atlas](http://veniceatlas.epfl.ch/): A multi-faceted historical document of the city developed collaboratively by students in a digital humanities course. The atlas uses tools including timelines, mapping, and 3D modeling to present aspects of Venice history ranging from geographical evolution to musical traditions.

[Mapping the Republic of Letters](http://republicofletters.stanford.edu/casestudies/index.html): An international correspondence network including many of the Enlightenment's major intellectual figures. The [Stanford Humanities Center](http://shc.stanford.edu/digital-humanities) compiled data from this huge set of exchanges and, through an extensive series of [case studies](http://republicofletters.stanford.edu/casestudies/index.html), crafted interactive visualizations to illuminate the movements and relationships behind them.

[Provoke: Digital Sound Studies](http://soundboxproject.com/about.html): A collection of projects which use sound in pushing the boundaries of scholarly presentation. In addition to the sonic documentation of their research areas, the authors of these projects also—as the name "Provoke" suggests—challenge existing modes of research and presentation, uniting the forwarding-thinking agendas of the digital humanities and of sound studies.

[The Comédie-Française Registers Project](http://cfregisters.org/): Collects and makes available to scholars more than a century's worth of historical data from the archives of a royal theater in Paris. CFRP is led by Jeff Ravel of MIT's history department and has been a long running project of HyperStudio. Right now, the contents of registers spanning from 1740 to 1793 are accessible through a faceted browser, which quickly filters and aggregates data across multiple categories and also links to scans of the original documents themselves.
